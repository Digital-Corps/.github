# The Digital Corps!

The Digital Corps is an on-campus agency of problem solvers, big thinkers, and creatives. We are Ball State University students from multiple disciplines who work together to create innovative solutions.

The Ball State University Digital Corps is a proud member of the Office of Information Technology. As part of the IT family, our primary goal is to serve as a catalyst to the campus community. We use technology in creative, innovative, and immersive directions to advance and support the mission and goals of the University.

## Join our Team!
Employment at the Digital Corps is available to any full-time enrolled student at Ball State University. We value diversity in thought and skill in our hiring process, and won’t fault you if you don’t know everything about technology just yet—in fact, we’ll teach you!

We have teams covering six different disciplines: Communication, Design, Development, Project Management, User Experience, and Video. When our teams collaborate, something great happens, and everyone benefits through solving problems with technology.
